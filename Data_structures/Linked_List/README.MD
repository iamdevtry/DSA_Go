# Linked List
- Is a fundamental data structure in computer science.
- Allows efficient insertion and removal of elements. (more efficient than arrays)
- Used to implement other data structures like stacks, queues, graphs, etc.

## What is a Linked List?
- Is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes.
- Each node connects to the next node using a pointer (in C/C++, Golang) or reference (in Java, Python, JavaScript).
- Each node contains two fields: data and a pointer/reference to the next node.
- Cuz of the nodes are not stored in contiguous memory locations, so we can insert and remove elements easily, at any position.

## Linked List Vs. Array
- Arrays:
  - Fixed size.
  - Contiguous memory locations.
  - Insertion and deletion are expensive.
  - Accessing elements is fast.
- Linked Lists:
  - Dynamic size.
  - Non-contiguous memory locations.
  - Insertion and deletion are fast.
  - Accessing elements is slow.

## Types of Linked Lists
1. Singly Linked List
2. Doubly Linked List
3. Circular Linked List
4. Doubly Circular Linked List
5. Header Linked List
